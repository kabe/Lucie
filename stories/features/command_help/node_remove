Story: read the 'node remove' help message
  As a cluster administrator
  I want to read help message of 'node remove' command
  So that I can understand how to remove a node from the system

  Scenario: node help remove
    When I run ./node help remove
    Then the first line of the help message should be a usage example
    And the help message should include a description of -t and --trace option
    And the help message should include a description of -h and --help option

  Scenario: node remove --help
    When I run ./node remove --help
    Then the first line of the help message should be a usage example
    And the help message should include a description of -t and --trace option
    And the help message should include a description of -h and --help option

  Scenario: node remove -h
    When I run ./node remove -h
    Then the first line of the help message should be a usage example
    And the help message should include a description of -t and --trace option
    And the help message should include a description of -h and --help option
