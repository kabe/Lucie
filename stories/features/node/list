Story: list nodes with 'node' command
  As a cluster administrator
  I want to get a node list using 'node' command
  So that I can get a node list

  Scenario: node list success (1 node, enabled)
    Given no node is added yet
    Given TEST_NODE is already added and is enabled with TEST_INSTALLER installer
    When I run ./node list
    Then the output should look like 'TEST_NODE (installer = TEST_INSTALLER)'

  Scenario: node list success (1 node, disabled)
    Given no node is added yet
    Given TEST_NODE is already added and is disabled
    When I run ./node list
    Then the output should look like 'TEST_NODE (DISABLED)'

  Scenario: node list success (0 node)
    Given no node is added yet
    When I run ./node list
    Then the output should look like 'No node is added yet.'
