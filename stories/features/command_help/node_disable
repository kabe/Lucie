Story: read the 'node disable' help message
  As a cluster administrator
  I want to read help message of 'node disable'
  So that I can understand how to disable a node

  Scenario: node help disable
    When I run ./node help disable
    Then the first line of the help message should be a usage example
    And the help message should include a description of -t and --trace option
    And the help message should include a description of -h and --help option

  Scenario: node disable --help
    When I run ./node disable --help
    Then the first line of the help message should be a usage example
    And the help message should include a description of -t and --trace option
    And the help message should include a description of -h and --help option

  Scenario: node disable -h
    When I run ./node disable -h
    Then the first line of the help message should be a usage example
    And the help message should include a description of -t and --trace option
    And the help message should include a description of -h and --help option
