Story: disable a node with 'node' command
  As a cluster administrator
  I want to disable a node using 'node' command
  So that I can disable installation

  Scenario: node disable success
    Given nodes directory is '/tmp/nodes'
    And lucied is started
    And no node is added yet
    And TEST_NODE node is added
    And TEST_NODE is enabled with TEST_INSTALLER installer
    When I run ./node disable TEST_NODE
    Then the output should look like '[info]  Node 'TEST_NODE' disabled.'
