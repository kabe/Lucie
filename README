Lucie is a cluster installation and configuration tool. It enables
parallel network installation of large numbers of nodes from one
single administration server. The Lucie installer performs HDD
partitioning and installations of the Linux kernel and required
software packages. The Lucie configurator then generates system and
software configurations. Lucie is designed to be scalable and
efficient, so a complete Linux cluster can be built from scratch in a
short amount of time. Moreover, the whole installation process is
designed to be fully automated.

Some part of Lucie is derived from FAI
(http://www.informatik.uni-koeln.de/fai/).
