Story: read the 'node list' help message
  As a cluster administrator
  I want to read help message of 'node list'
  So that I can understand how to get nodes list

  Scenario: node help list
    When I run ./node help list
    Then the first line of the help message should be a usage example
    And the help message should include a description of -t and --trace option
    And the help message should include a description of -v and --verbose option
    And the help message should include a description of -h and --help option

  Scenario: node list --help
    When I run ./node list --help
    Then the first line of the help message should be a usage example
    And the help message should include a description of -t and --trace option
    And the help message should include a description of -v and --verbose option
    And the help message should include a description of -h and --help option

  Scenario: node list -h
    When I run ./node list -h
    Then the first line of the help message should be a usage example
    And the help message should include a description of -t and --trace option
