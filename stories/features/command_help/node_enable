Story: read the 'node enable' help message
  As a cluster administrator
  I want to read help message of 'node enable'
  So that I can understand how to enable a node

  Scenario: node help enable
    When I run ./node help enable

    And the help message should include a description of -i and --installer option
    And the help message should include a description of -v and --verbose option
    And the help message should include a description of -t and --trace option
    And the help message should include a description of -h and --help option

  Scenario: node enable --help
    When I run ./node enable --help
    Then the first line of the help message should be a usage example
    And the help message should include a description of -i and --installer option
    And the help message should include a description of -v and --verbose option
    And the help message should include a description of -t and --trace option
    And the help message should include a description of -h and --help option

  Scenario: node enable -h
