Story: start lucie daemon
  As a cluster administrator
  I want to start lucied process
  So that I can run 'node' and 'installer' commands without root privilege

  Scenario: start lucied succeeds
    Given no other lucied is running
    When I start lucied
    Then PID file is created
    And pwd is RAILS_ROOT

  Scenario: start lucied fails if another lucied is running
    Given no other lucied is running
    When I start lucied
    When I start another lucied
    Then I get error message 'FAILED: Another Lucie daemon is already running.'
