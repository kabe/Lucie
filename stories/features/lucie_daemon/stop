Story: stop lucie daemon
  As a cluster administrator
  I want to stop lucied process
  So that I can restart lucied process

  Scenario: stop lucied succeeds
    Given no other lucied is running
    And I start lucied
    When I stop lucied
    Then lucied successfully stops
    And I get message '[info]  Lucie daemon stopped.'
    And PID file ./tmp/pids/lucied.pid is deleted

  Scenario: stop lucied fails if no lucied is running
    Given no other lucied is running
    When I stop lucied
    Then I get error message '[error] Lucie daemon not running (no pid file).'
