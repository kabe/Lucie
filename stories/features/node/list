Story: list nodes with 'node' command
  As a cluster administrator
  I want to get a node list using 'node' command
  So that I can get a node list

  Scenario: node list success (1 node, enabled)
    Given no node is added yet
    And TEST_NODE is added
    And TEST_NODE is enabled with TEST_INSTALLER installer
    When I run ./node list
    Then the output should look like '     ready TEST_NODE (installer = TEST_INSTALLER)'

  Scenario: node list success (1 node, enabled)
    Given no node is added yet
    And TEST_NODE is added
    And TEST_NODE is enabled with TEST_INSTALLER installer
    And TEST_NODE is succeeded to install
    And TEST_NODE is disabled
    When I run ./node list
    Then the output should look like '   success TEST_NODE (installer = TEST_INSTALLER)'

  Scenario: node list success (1 node, enabled)
    Given no node is added yet
    And TEST_NODE is added
    And TEST_NODE is enabled with TEST_INSTALLER installer
    And TEST_NODE is failed to install
    When I run ./node list
    Then the output should look like '      fail TEST_NODE (installer = TEST_INSTALLER)'

  Scenario: node list success (1 node, enabled)
    Given no node is added yet
    And TEST_NODE is added
    And TEST_NODE is enabled with TEST_INSTALLER installer
    And TEST_NODE is incomplete
    When I run ./node list
    Then the output should look like 'incomplete TEST_NODE (installer = TEST_INSTALLER)'

  Scenario: node list success (1 node, disabled)
    Given no node is added yet
    And TEST_NODE is added
    And TEST_NODE is enabled with TEST_INSTALLER installer
    And TEST_NODE is disabled
    When I run ./node list
    Then the output should look like '           TEST_NODE (installer = TEST_INSTALLER)'

  Scenario: node list success (0 node)
    Given no node is added yet
    When I run ./node list
    Then the output should look like 'No node is added yet.'
