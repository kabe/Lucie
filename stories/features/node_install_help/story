Story: read the 'node install' help message
  As a cluster administrator
  I want to read help message of 'node install'
  So that I can understand how to install a node

  Scenario: node help list
    When I run ./node help install
    Then the first line of the help message should be a usage example
    And the help message should include a description of -s and --script option
    And the help message should include a description of -t and --trace option
    And the help message should include a description of -h and --help option
